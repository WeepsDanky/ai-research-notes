# Setup the environment 

There are two types of code here mainly: **tutorial**, or **engineering**. Previous code mainly aims to show the mathematical principles of processes in training large language model, the later mainly aim to build reusable components for training production-grade LLMs. 

For engineering part, we mainly use [verl](https://github.com/volcengine/verl/) framework developed by ByteDance team for training LLMs, and [ai-toolkit](https://github.com/ostris/ai-toolkit) to train/finetune diffusion models.
